I upload my automation practics to this repo. Basically i scrape informations such as texts from websites. For these scripts to work on your systems, you might have to have some changes in the source codes such as local paths that i specified or browser confugirations or the static element you want to scrape. I am a beginner so i try my best to optimize my skills. :):):)
